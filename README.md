# Warwick Minecraft Society Discord Bot
Currently, this bot only exists to post a single message with added buttons (Discord Components), since discord does not support Components with Webhooks, despite the API claiming it does.

## Usage
Set the environment variable `WMCS_DISCORD_TOKEN` to the token of the bot and install requirements.  
Run `bot.py` and run the command `WMCS!mcguide` where you want the guide message.
